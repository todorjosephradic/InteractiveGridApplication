# InteractiveGridApplication

# The Interactive Grid Application is designed to be run using Google Chrome and is intended for use by people who cannot use their hands or have hand-based disabilities. But it can also be used by people without
# hand-based disabilities.

# The application uses Camera Mouse software for head-position-tracking to map the user's head movement to the movement of the cursor. Voice command input is used to perform the
# click action of the cursor. Input must be performed with voice-input (can be any sound or word e.g. "click"). The mouse can be used to move the cursor.

# It contains a grid that can have the colour of the squares changed, or to be used to play Noughts and Crosses.
